Additionally, the review contains punctuation and capitalization variations that should be standardized for consistency. Furthermore, stopwords (common words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\") may need to be removed to focus on meaningful content. Tokenization is also necessary to break down the text into individual words or tokens for analysis.

big fan of asian cinema the truth is the movie is infantile in construction long winded and painfully disjointed i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock s school of thought don t tell them show them then you could try to appreciate this movie but you would still be hard pressed first of all the terrorizers tries stream of consciousness in the style of jean luc godard and fails in this edward yang seems to understand the basics of the technique but he s very unskilled at it perhaps he gets better with age i don t know as i haven t yet attempted other yang films the point is he uses a dearth of show don t tell that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story sure he gets in some visually arresting images but they don t draw the story together and they don t help to make it any better additionally the major concept behind stream of consciousness and show don t tell is that with the right images the right drama repetition and tight correlation the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences not to say that these will be the correct inferences but those can be amended as the story progresses and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction in this edward yang sorely disappoints the viewer is constantly on the periphery there is no reason to be drawn in no reason to consider the characters or their motives no reason to get emotionally involved and really no reason to stay alert finally yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell not the story that the movie itself is telling his art moves in one direction but like a large dog he can t control he s constantly yanking the lead trying to get it back onto the course he wants not the one that it is naturally following the most egregious example of this is the ending the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband s revelation the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on and by extension a possible ending for the movie has already been told to us if yang had chosen to end at that point he would have had a much more powerful piece leaving the watcher in suspense does the story play out as the book says or does yang s real world play out differently asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that yang painfully needs instead he continues to tell the story he wants to tell straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character we didn t need to know more about her superficially and yang wouldn t feel the need to tell us if he hadn t made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with why else does yang prolong and torture his movie to get in some more of those visually arresting images the movie truly suffers for it it wants to end it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled but instead yang pushes on instead yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on causing him or her to constantly ask so what the first ending the one that yang ignored that was good the second ending well my thought wasso what who cares because it s not as if it is introducing something that hasn t been put forth in the storyline already but the last ending that really was a waste of time not only did the real ending leave me disengaged but i also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum melancholy noir tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather its post production the subbing if you see it subbed is horrible long sentences stay up for a second or two while short ones stay up far too long also as yang quickly changes images the subtitles are removed from the screen this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed because there s not much dialog going on anyway\",\n          \"supposedly director william shatner had in mind a much darker film when it came to star trek v the final frontier but the suits at paramount looking at the huge box office receipts taken in by its humor filled predecessor insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast there are bad ideas aplenty along with a few good ones and if you re in a charitable mood you could look at the final frontier the same way you would a so so episode of the tv series on the plus side laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best guest star performances in any star trek big or small screen ranking right up there with william windom s commodore decker his portrayal of sybok spock s half brother consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink which happens all too frequently charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd too bad his role isn t as large as he is if the story about shatner s intentions is true then i owe him an apology because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not very convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet the reason is i ve always felt that of all the trek regulars shatner was the least tuned in to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans having read his trek memoirs it s very apparent to me that he considered the show another action adventure series that just happened to have a science fiction setting he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry coon was known for his work on the popular western series the wild wild west shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was a piece of the action a silly second season episode co written by coon so finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action filled flick with lots of tongue in cheek humor well somebody did because that s what the final frontier ended up being shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and as leonard maltin points out the film suffers from a bad case of the cutes in the opening scene at yosemite national park it s hard to say which is worse the super cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from wrath of khan and by this the fifth trek movie have run themselves into the ground so has the idea of a skeleton crew one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two it s a pointless subplot and adds nothing the climactic scene where god is encountered doesn t add much either whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable but the scene itself doesn t make much sense the god creature s abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from the search for spock leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock s integrity even while spouting such un spock like lines as get a grip on yourself doctor and deforest kelley as usual outperforms both shatner and nimoy he really came on as an actor in the final trek films so this trek outing isn t terrible it just isn t very good there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the next generation and it was far better suited to the task than star trek v the final frontier\",\n          \"pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however it s just too dull for it s own good all the characters are ok and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real and as a result they were extremely disturbing it s well made and decently written and it started out really interesting but it just couldn t keep up the pace plus i found the ending to be disappointing linnea quigley has no more then a very small role in this so i was also disappointed about that and stephen knight does a good job as the lead as he was pretty twisted plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil along with a bunch of other horror films there is lots of bloodhowever it s not all that gory and for it s low budget it was pretty well done however as i said it just couldn t sustain it s interest this is a pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however it s just too dull for it s own good i would passbut i guess it s worth a watch if you have nothing better to do the direction is ok elly kenner norman thaddeus vane do an ok job here with decent camera work and doing a good job on it s low budget however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking the acting is actually alright stephen knight is great as the lead he was creepy twisted sick and gave a very creepy performance the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person linnea quigley did well in her small role christopher mcdonald is ok i guess sin his short time rest of the cast are ok as well overall i would pass but i guess it s worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do 1 2 out of 5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

The classification layer then predicts the sequence's label based on these representations.

        "The below cell evaluates the trained BERT model's performance on the test dataset. First, it initializes tracking variables to store predictions and true labels. Then, it iterates over batches of data from the test data loader. For each batch, it moves the data to the GPU (if available) and performs a forward pass through the model to obtain logits, which represent the model's raw predictions. The logits and corresponding true labels are then transferred to the CPU and stored. After iterating through all batches, the logits are converted into predicted labels by taking the argmax along the second axis (axis=1) to select the label with the highest probability. These predicted labels are aggregated into a single list and stored in `prediction_scores`. We will be using these prediction scores to compute the values of various metrics."

        "\n",
        "1. **Process the Review Text**:\n",
        "   - Use the `process_text` function to preprocess the review text. Store the preprocessed text in `processed_text`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenize the Text**:\n",
        "   - Use the `tokenizer.encode_plus()` method to tokenize the `processed_text`.\n",
